## Welcome to my GitHub page.

This website collects misc. code files I've come across over the years.  I maintain and preview the content for the website in Markdown files.

This page runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is dynamically rebuilt when files in the underlying repositories change.
